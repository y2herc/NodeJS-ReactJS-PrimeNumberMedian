The frontend was created using ReactJS and the backend was created using Node.js.
The frontend contains a validated input within a Form that takes the input and submits it to the a backend REST API which then returns a median of the Prime Numbers till input number and populates under Results on the UI. 

You can find further instructions as to how to run the apps under each individual Readme.md within their folders.
